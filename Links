What is OOP in Lua
https://devforum.roblox.com/t/all-about-object-oriented-programming/8585

/// Goes over Object Oriented Program (OOP) in lua as well as other usefull thing as well as going over MetaTables [Required]
reasons why we need to learn this specfically for Turn based 

OOP and Metatable are really advance topics, with that said itâ€™s perfect for the job!

So you create a Base_Class for all NPCs

Why do you need a Base_Class?
Because all NPCs will have the same basic stats like; Health, Damage, Armor, WalkSpeed, EXPOnDeath, ItemDrops, etc
They will also have basic functions like; Move,Attack,Spawn,Die etc

You know like Humans;
Gender, Age, Race, etc

then you create another Class for specific types of NPCs like
Lava_Class; Has fire skills, Immune to Fire Magic etc,

With OOP and MetaTables it will make your Code really clean and very organized.
