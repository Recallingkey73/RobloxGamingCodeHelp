# RobloxGamingCodeHelp
this is a repository for me to look back on code that I found that may be helpful for future projects, little to none of this will probably be my own code, I will try to mark down whos it is at the bottom of the index

this is only ment for me to learn how to code better by having something to look and understand some of this might not even be usuable code
